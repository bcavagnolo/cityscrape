Introduction
============

I'm perpetually curious about property data, and I want to learn about node. So
I'm using node to scrape, transform, organize, and store property data. Fun,
right?

Set Up
======

You'll need a mongodb install somewhere. I just do it on my Ubuntu localhost
following [the usual
documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

Then it should just be ```npm install```.

Usage
=====

If you dare scrape and store property data, say ```./sfgate.js --help```. You
may just want to grab the first hundred pages or so to fool around.
